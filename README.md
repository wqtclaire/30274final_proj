# Quantifying Temporal Land Cover Change Using *rioxarray*
### Claire Wang | 11/27/2020
#### My repository of final project of IDCE 30274 - Programming GIS. This project is about temporal analysis on land-cover change.

## Data Source
- Land cover data from [Clark Labs](https://clarklabs.org/aquaculture/). This site owns a public inventory of pond aquaculture and coastal habitats in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Landcover maps are in development for the years 1999, 2014, and 2018 for these countries. 
- [rioxarray](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/stable/) and [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Python libraries to calculate and plot raster dataset. Some [Turorials](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/aio/index.html) can be found here, along with tutorials of [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/), the library for vector data.
